# Deleting A Giveaway

When you don't want to give something away anymore, or you simply want to re-create a giveaway, you can delete it easily using Giveaway Boat.

Before getting started, be aware that, once the giveaway is deleted, all of the participants are removed, the giveaway message is deleted, and you can no longer configure the giveaway or get a winner out of it.

## Using the Dashboard to edit a giveaway

To start, head on to the dashboard by clicking [here](https://giveaway.boats/dashboard). Find your server and click the "Dashboard" button next to it.

Click the "Giveaways" button in the navigation bar at the top to view all giveaways. Click the "Delete" button next to the giveaway you want to delete.

You will now see a dialog which states the danger of deleting a giveaway. If you're fine with it, click the "Yes, delete it!" button.

## Using slash commands to delete a giveaway

Use the `/giveaway delete` command. As `message-id`, pass in the giveaway ID. Find out how to get it [here](../faq.md#how-to-get-giveaway-ids--message-ids). Execute the command and the giveaway will be deleted.

## Using prefix commands to delete a giveaway

Use the `g.delete` command to delete.

Usage: g.delete (giveaway id)

Example: g.delete 1209450876981346415

## End Result

Once you do all of the steps correctly, the giveaway message will be deleted, and you will no longer be able to do anything with it.
