From the page that opens up, you can edit almost all options. Once you edit the options, you can click the "Save Changes" button to finish off.

## Using slash commands to edit a giveaway

Use the `/giveaway edit` command. As `message-id`, pass in the giveaway ID. Find out how to get it [here](../faq.md#how-to-get-giveaway-ids--message-ids). When all of the options show, edit it to however you like. Then execute the command.

Use the `g.edit` command to edit.

Usage: g.edit (giveaway id) --option value

Example: g.edit 1209450876981346415 --host host

## End Result

Once you do all of the steps correctly, the giveaway message will be edited and the changes will be shown instantly.
