# Language

Giveaway Boat supports multiple languages for ease-of-use.
The only noticeable change will be in the bot's command responses. This does not affect the dashboard.

The languages supported includes:

- English
- Deutsch
- Español
- Français
- Indonesia

## Setup

In the dashboard "Settings" tab, select the "Giveaway Creator Roles" option and then select the new language from the opened dropdown menu.
