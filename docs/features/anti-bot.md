# Anti-Bot Captcha

This feature allows you to keep bots out of your participants list by redirecting people who want to join to an official Giveaway Boat link and letting [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/) figure out if the person is a bot or not. If the person is a bot, they will not be allowed to participate.

## Enabling

### Dashboard
