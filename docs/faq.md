## Invite / Server join requirements

This is against Discord's Platform Manipulation Policy. This feature will never be added to the bot.

> Individuals are prohibited from attempting to manipulate engagement metrics, artificially inflating server membership (for example, via “join-for-join,” “invite rewards,” purchasing fake members), and selling artificial engagement services for online platforms. Individuals also may not attempt to buy or sell Discord assets, such as accounts, usernames, servers, server permissions, or custom server invite links (also called “vanity URLs”).

> Invite reward servers are servers that promise some form of perk, often financial, for inviting and getting other users to join said server. We strongly discourage this activity, as it often results in spamming users with unsolicited messages. If it leads to spam or another form of abuse, we may take action including removing the users and server.
